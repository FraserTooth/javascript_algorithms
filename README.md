Implementations of Various Algorithms in Javascript.  
All problems have unit test coverage.  

## Why Javascript?

Its my strongest language at the moment, and given the impressive progress that V8 is making I think that Javascript has a great future.  
Plus I'm sometimes a little lazy and just want some loose typing ðŸ˜‚  
I've tended to focus on CS concepts and data structures, I also spent time here learning Regex etc.  

## Challenges Done So Far:

1. Word Abbreviation - Test of Text Manupulation (_From CodeWars_)
2. Square Into Squares - A Tricky bit of Mathsy stuff, I solved using Recursion (_From CodeWars_)
3. FizzBuzz - Done using a string and ternary operators.
4. Add Two Numbers - Sums Involving Linked Lists, Solved Using Recursion (_From LeetCode_)
5. Group Anagrams - Identifying and Grouping Anagrams, Solves Using Regex and Loops (_From LeetCode_)
6. Unique Paths - Dynamic Programming Problem, Solved Using Brute Force then Sped up Using Top Down Approach (_From LeetCode_)
7. Sort Colors - Sort Challenge, First Solved with Count Sort then Applied a Context Specific Sort (_From LeetCode_)
8. Letter Combinations Phone Number - Backtracking Problem, Solved using Recursion and a Lookup Table (_From LeetCode_)
9. Flatten Array with Stack - Basic Challenge, but had to solve using a Stack instead of Recursion (_From a Coding Interview_)
10. Histogram - Convert an Array into a Histogram, Solved with a Half Count Sort and Early Escape Loop (_From an Interview_)
11. Regex Examples - Learning Regex for Efficient Searches etc. (_From Tutorial on HackerRank_)
12. Odd Even Linked List - Reordering a Linked List, done using brute force, reworked using pointer solution (_From LeetCode_)
13. Binary Tree Traverse In-Order - Binary Tree Traversal, Implemented Iteratively Using Stack (_From LeetCode_)
14. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree - Binary Tree Work, Implemented Using Queue and Iterative Solution but may not be the most efficient (_From LeetCode_)
15. Longest Substring without Repeating Characters - Array/String Problem, Implemented Using a Dequeue and Includes, may be faster with a Set (_From LeetCode_)
16. Column To Number Conversion - Converting the Excel-style Column Headers to a Number, solved using Ascii Codes and Base Manupulation (_From LeetCode_)
