Implementations of Various Algorithms in Javascript

## Why Javascript?

Its my strongest language at the moment, and given the impressive progress that V8 is making I think that Javascript has a great future.  
Plus I'm sometimes a little lazy and just want some loose typing ðŸ˜‚

## Challenges Done So Far:

1. Word Abbreviation - Test of Text Manupulation (_From CodeWars_)
2. Square Into Squares - A Tricky bit of Mathsy stuff, I solved using Recursion (_From CodeWars_)
3. FizzBuzz - Done using a string and ternary operators.
4. Add Two Numbers - Sums Involving Linked Lists, Solved Using Recursion (_From LeetCode_)
5. Group Anagrams - Identifying and Grouping Anagrams, Solves Using Regex and Loops (_From LeetCode_)
6. Unique Paths - Dynamic Programming Problem, Solved Using Brute Force then Sped up Using Top Down Approach (_From LeetCode_)
7. Sort Colors - Sort Challenge, First Solved with Count Sort then Applied a Context Specific Sort (_From LeetCode_)
8. Letter Combinations Phone Number - Backtracking Problem, Solved using Recursion and a Lookup Table (_From LeetCode_)
9. Flatten Array with Stack - Basic Challenge, but had to solve using a Stack instead of Recursion or something (_From a Coding Interview_)
10. Histogram - Convert an Array into a Histogram, Solved with a Half Count Sort and Early Escape Loop (_From an Interview_)
11. Regex Examples - Learning Regex for Efficient Searches etc. (_From Tutorial on HackerRank_)
12. Odd Even Linked List - Reordering a Linked List, done using brute force, reworked using pointer solution (_From LeetCode_)
